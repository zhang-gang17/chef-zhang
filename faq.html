                        Most inquiries would preferrably come through either

                        <a class="contact" href="mailto:henryzhang36@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>.

                    Is kitchen cleanup included?

                    <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
                        Yes, all menu prices essentially incorporate a "service fee" which includes cleaning both the dining and kitchen areas
                        as well as washing any kitchenware used.

                <div class="accordion-item-header">
                    What kitchenware and/or kitchen setup do you require?
                </div>

                        Ideally, you would have the kitchenware needed for the dishes you have requested: please make sure to complete the order form as accurately as possible.
                        In the event that you lack sufficient kitchenware, I will be able to provide the remainder. However, this may result in additional fees depending on how much
                        missing kitchenware is needed.
                        <br><br>
                        A gas stovetop is also preferred over an electric one, although the latter works as well. Just note that the difference in heating time and heat distribution 
                        between gas and electric stoves can compromise dish quality. I will always do my best to make adjustments on electric stoves to ensure you receive a dining experience 
                        which meets your expectations.

                        As long as you live within 1km of the University of Toronto - St. George Campus, I will be able to safely bring ingredients and necessary
                        kitchenware to your location. If you remain unsure about whether or not I can service your location, feel free to contact me for an exact answer.

                    How many people can you cook for?

                    <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
                        I consider 1-4 people to be within my serviceable range, although wait time for certain dishes will be a concern for groups 
                        larger than 2. If you have concerns about your group size, feel free to contact me for a more definitive answer.
                        <br><br>
                        As a one-man-team, you will find the answer to generally be no. That being said, catering can be considered on a case-by-case basis, 
                        largely dependent on the size of the event and the desired menu. Contact me if you have questions about catering and we can work out the feasibility 
                        and details from there.

                    How fresh are the ingredients used?

                    <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
                        I go grocery shopping on a weekly basis, and depending on the nature of the ingredients used, some may be bought during such weekly trips.
                        <br><br>
                        More commonly, I will make a dedicated trip 1-2 days in advance of your booking to ensure the freshest produce and vegetables possible.

                        Similar to many other FAQs, this is also handled on a case-by-case basis. 
                        <br><br>
                        If I own or can borrow the necessary kitchenware, have enough turnaround to learn and practice the recipe, and the ingredients can be acquired in 
                        downtown Toronto without major inconveniences, you will find the answer to be yes. Time is by far the most important factor though, so make sure 
                        to give me plenty of headsup if you plan on doing so!
